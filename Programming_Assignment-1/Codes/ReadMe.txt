1. Scripts were written using Python 2.7 and uses NUMPY and ITERTOOLS as extra libraries.
2. The Project contains 3 folders and each folder contain scripts for the structures CHAIN, BINARY TREE and GRID GRAPH.
3. Each folder contains 3 Python scripts which represents the 3 Algorithms BRUTE FORCE, BELIEF PROPGATION and DIRECTED SAMPLING
4. SAME files implements both SMALLER and LARGER version of the graphs.
5. Each file is independent of each other. Therefore can be run just by "python filename.py"

Project Structure is:
Folders: "BinaryTree, Chain, GridGraph"

Folder "BinaryTree" contains scripts: 
BinaryTreeBeliefPropagation.py
BinaryTreeBruteForce.py
BinaryTreeSampling.py

Folder "Chain" contains scripts: 
ChainBeliefPropagation.py
ChainTreeBruteForce.py
ChainTreeSampling.py

Folder "GridGraph" contains scripts: 
GridGraphBeliefPropagation.py
GridGraphBruteForce.py
GridGraphSampling.py
